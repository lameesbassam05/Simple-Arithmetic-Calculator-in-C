## üõ†Ô∏è How to Compile & Run

1. Save the code as `calculator.c`
2. Open your terminal or CMD
3. Compile using GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc calculator.c -o calculator


üß™ Example Output

Enter number:
12
Enter other number:
4
The sum is: 16
12 + 4 = 16

The difference is: 8
12 - 4 = 8

The product is: 48
12 * 4 = 48

The quotient is: 3
12 / 4 = 3

The remainder is: 0
12 % 4 = 0
